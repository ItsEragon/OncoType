The dataset used for training this project is hosted on Kaggle.

Dataset Name: Blood Cells Cancer (ALL) dataset
Description:
This dataset consists of 3,242 peripheral blood smear (PBS) images collected from 89 patients suspected of Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (ALL). The dataset is divided into two primary classes: benign and malignant. The malignant class includes three subtypes of ALL lymphoblastsâ€”Early Pre-B, Pre-B, and Pro-B. All images were captured using a Zeiss microscope camera at 100x magnification and stored in JPG format. The images were prepared in the bone marrow lab of Taleqani Hospital (Tehran, Iran), and the diagnosis of cell types was confirmed by a specialist using flow cytometry.
